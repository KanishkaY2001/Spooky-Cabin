# Spooky Cabin in the Woods
**Spooky Cabin**, a scene developed on Unity, is a project which I undertook while completing the Comp1150 course in Macquarie University (NSW). This project is a take on the classic "Cabin in the Woods", which creates an eerie and horrific atmosphere, making use of various prefabs, terrain elements, and illusive effects.
